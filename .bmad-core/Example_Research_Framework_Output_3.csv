Citation Aim(s) Data Disparity Methods (related to 
disparities)
Findings (related to disparities)
Subtopic: alcohol use
38 Use models to identify 
patterns of high-risk 
drinking
Web-based survey 
of Brazilian medical 
students (n = 4,254 
medical students)
Disparity type: outcome and ML 
performance variation associated 
with sociodemographic subgroups
Disparity variables: age, gender 
(and gender identification), sexual 
orientation, income, marital status, 
has children, living situation and 
social considerations such as quality 
of family and friend relationships
Random forest, 
GLMNET and ANN for 
prediction of high-risk 
drinking. LIME for 
feature importance 
and explanation.
Either lower or higher (that is, not 
middle) income, being single, 
being bisexual and tobacco and 
cannabis use were the most 
important predictors of high-risk 
drinking. Lower precision was 
seen in female-specific models 
for high-risk drinking, but higher 
precision for low-risk drinking 
models.
40 Identify predictors of 
screening for alcohol 
quantity
Data from National 
Alcohol Survey 
(n = 9,668 respondents)
Disparity type: outcome variation 
associated with sociodemographic 
subgroups
Disparity variables: gender, age, race/
ethnicity, education, marital status, 
primary care source and insurance
Logistic regression 
and CART to predict 
screening of alcohol 
usage quantity.
In logistic regression results, 
college graduates and those 
over 35 years of age were 
more likely to be screened for 
alcohol use. CART results find 
additional subgroups, including 
that nonwhite individuals with 
high school education (or less 
education than high school) were 
less likely to be screened for 
alcohol use quantity.
Subtopic: opioid use
39 To find evidence to 
support individualized 
approach to improve 
outcome of cessation 
attempts
1,192 African American 
and 2,557 European 
ancestry. Each ML 
model had a different 
combination of these 
two
Disparity type: outcome variation 
associated with sociodemographic 
subgroups
Disparity variables: race (African 
American versus European ancestry)
Support vector 
machine to classify for 
opioid use cessation 
versus noncessation.
Racial differences included 
a stronger association with 
substance initiation for antisocial 
behaviors in European ancestry 
children than African American 
children, and a stronger 
association with African American 
for gambling problems than with 
European ancestry.
41 Subgroup analysis 
to identify what 
characteristics 
beyond race make 
individuals vulnerable 
to receive opioid use 
disorder care
Substance use 
disorder dataset from 
Treatment Episode 
Data Set admissions 
(A) (n = 188,637 
from California and 
n = 184,276 from 
Maryland)
Disparity type: outcome variation 
associated with sociodemographic 
subgroups
Disparity variables: race/ethnicity, 
homelessness status, age, gender, 
marital status, education level, 
employment status, income and 
pregnancy status
Virtual twins (random 
forest in stage 1; 
decision tree in stage 
2) for prediction 
of wait times and 
explanation of 
heterogeneity.
Longer wait times were 
associated with being African 
American as opposed to white. 
Individuals who were African 
American and also homeless 
had the longest waiting times for 
treatment.
Subtopic: substance agnostic
17 To understand topics 
of discussion on 
Twitter in association 
with telehealth for 
mental health
Tweets from 2014 to 
2021 (n = 353,554)
Disparity type: subgroup 
representation in the data
Disparity variables: subpopulations 
identified in topic analysis: military, 
veterans, children and parents
BERTopic used to 
extract primary topics 
of discussion.
Primary topics were anxiety, 
depression, addiction and 
rehabilitation, but subpopulation 
discussions shifted from 
a prepandemic emphasis 
on military, veterans and 
posttraumatic stress disorder to 
child- and parent-focused issues 
during the pandemic.
42 To examine the 
disparities in the 
completion of 
substance use 
disorder treatment
Treatment Episode 
Data Set discharges (D) 
(n = 649,479)
Disparity type: outcome variation 
associated with sociodemographic 
subgroups
Disparity variables: race/ethnicity, 
income source, gender, age, health 
insurance and veteran
Virtual twins (random 
forest in stage 1; 
decision tree in stage 
2) used to predict 
treatment completion 
and explain 
heterogeneity.
Individuals more likely to 
complete treatment do not have 
co-occurring mental health 
condition, have income from a job 
and are white non-Hispanic
