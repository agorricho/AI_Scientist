Citation Aim(s) Data Disparity Methods (related to 
disparities)
Findings (related to disparities)
Subtopic: suicide
31 To evaluate racial 
differences in the 
performance of 
statistical model in 
suicide prediction
Data from 7 health 
systems, EHR and 
insurance claims data 
(n = 1,398,070 visits by 
1,433,543 patients)
Disparity type: ML model 
subgroup performance 
variation associated with 
sociodemographic subgroups
Disparity variables: race/
ethnicity (all)
To predict suicide within 
90 days of a mental 
health visit where 
logistic regression with 
LASSO and random 
forest were applied.
Models for specific race/ethnic 
subgroups performed poorly 
compared with population models. 
Thus, predictive performance is not as 
good for those in the Black, American 
Indian/Alaskan Native or no race/
ethnicity recorded subgroups.
32 Examine how specific 
data types affect 
accuracy of suicide 
prediction models
Health record and 
insurance information 
on patients, 13 years 
of age and older, 
from 2009 to 2015 
(n = 2,960,929)
Disparity type: ML model 
performance associated 
within inclusion of 
sociodemographic variables
Disparity variables: race/
ethnicity and neighborhood 
characteristics
Logistic regression with 
LASSO for prediction of 
suicide attempts.
Additional data, including 
sociodemographic data, improved 
prediction accuracy.
35 Characterize 
homicide–suicide 
decedents in the 
United States
CDC NVDRS Restricted 
Access Database. From 
2003 to 2015 (n = 2,447)
Disparity type: ML model 
subgroup performance 
variation
Disparity variables: gender, 
race, age group, marital status 
and military service
Latent class analysis for 
subtype identification. 
LASSO logistic 
regression with one 
versus rest to determine 
characteristics 
associated with 
subtypes.
Eight homicide–suicide subtypes were 
found. Demographic characteristics 
were associated with each type.
33 To find evidence 
of the impact of 
hospitalization on 
suicide prevention
Data from California 
Office of Statewide 
Health Planning 
and Development, 
deliberate self-harm 
visits from January 
2009 to December 
2011 (n = 57,312)
Disparity type: outcome 
variation associated with 
sociodemographic subgroups
Disparity variables: gender, 
age
Generalized random 
forest for prediction 
of suicide risk within 
30 days and 1 year of a 
hospitalization.
More suicide risk was found for 
patients who were male, aged 10–29 
and 50 years of age or greater.
34 Identify factors of 
suicidal ideation 
among teenagers in 
Korea and examine 
the link between 
these factors and 
socioeconomic status
Data from Korea 
Youth Risk Behavior 
Web-based Survey 
(n = 54,948 youth from 
800 schools in 17 
cities)
Disparity type: outcome 
variation associated with 
sociodemographic subgroups
Disparity variables: 
sample focused on 
adolescents; gender, 
academic performance and 
socioeconomic status
XGBoost with SMOTE 
used for prediction of 
suicidal ideation.
Suicidal risk factors for Korean 
adolescents in the high 
socioeconomic group were academic 
achievement as opposed to emotional 
stress and anxiety for those in the low 
SES group. Higher levels of risk were 
shown to be associated with those in 
the lower SES group.
Subtopic: violent environments
36 Identify the most 
relevant factors 
associated with 
different confessed 
domains of violence
Data from large sample 
of ex-members of 
Colombian illegal 
armed groups 
(n = 26,349)
Disparity type: ML 
model performance as 
a result of inclusion of 
sociodemographic features
Disparity variables: age, 
gender and education
Deep neural network, 
random forest classifier 
for recursive feature 
elimination.
Classification of those committing past 
acts of violence was more accurate 
when including sociodemographic 
factors. Effects of individual 
sociodemographic features (that is, 
age, gender and education) were used 
for matching in the analysis; effects 
of those individual features were not 
reported.
37 Impact of living in 
politically violent 
environments on the 
mental and cognitive 
health of children
Primary data extracted 
from the national 
health behavior in 
school-age children 
study conducted 
in Palestinian 
territories (n = 6,374 
schoolchildren)
Disparity type: ML 
model performance as 
a result of inclusion of 
sociodemographic features
Disparity variables: age, 
parents’ education, family 
income, place of residence, 
school type and additional 
variables such as social 
support
Random forest, artificial 
neural network, support 
vector machine, 
gradient boost, decision 
tree and k-nearest 
neighbors used for 
classification of 
domains of violence.
Maltreatment and exposure to political 
violence were the top two most 
important features when considering 
impacts to lower cognitive ability. 
Academic performance of boys 
was inversely related to exposure to 
political violence. While age was not 
found to be a significant predictor, 
variables such as living in an urban 
area with more exposure to violence 
were found to be associated with more 
mental health issues
